# Sleep Disorder Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict **sleep disorders** using patient lifestyle and health data. It demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline: from data analysis and preprocessing to model building and evaluation.

## Problem Statement

The goal is to analyze personal and health-related attributes (e.g., age, BMI, stress level, etc.) to classify individuals into:
- No Sleep Disorder
- Insomnia
- Sleep Apnea

---

## Key Features

- Performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends
- Handled **missing values and categorical encoding**
- Trained classification models like:
  - Random Forest
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
- Achieved good accuracy and model performance
- Evaluated results using confusion matrix, classification report

---

## Tech Stack

- Python, Machine Learning
- Model Building, EDA, Preprocessing Data
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Seaborn, Matplotlib

---

## Learnings

- Understood the impact of health/lifestyle factors on sleep quality.
- Gained hands-on experience in classification modeling.
- Learned how to build ML pipelines in the healthcare domain.
